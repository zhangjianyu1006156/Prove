# Prove
This is a Python implementation of a memory card game that challenges your memory and mathematical skills. The game is played on a 3x4 grid of cards, each card having a number. The objective is to create valid mathematical equations using the numbers on the cards and replace them with new ones from a shuffled deck. Your goal is to maximize your score by creating equations quickly and efficiently.



## Prerequisites
1.Python 3.x

2.Matplotlib library



## Getting Started
1.Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/memory-card-game.git
```



2.Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd memory-card-game
```



3.Run the game:
```bash
python memory_card_game.py
```

## Gameplay Instructions
1.Upon starting the game, you will be prompted to enter your name.

2.You will see a 3x4 grid of cards with numbers. These cards are randomly shuffled from a deck.

3.You need to create valid mathematical equations using the numbers on the cards. The equations must be constructed using suitable syntax, with double equals signs (e.g., 24 == 17 + 7).

4.To select numbers from the grid for your equation, simply type them with spaces in between, e.g., 24 == 17 + 7.

5.If your equation is correct and follows the syntax rules, the selected cards will be replaced with new ones from the deck.

6.Your score increases as you successfully create equations. The game continues until you use all the cards in the deck or until the time runs out.

7.Pay attention to the time remaining, the number of cards used, and the number of cards remaining.

8.Try to maximize your score by solving equations quickly and efficiently.

9.The game ends when you either use all the cards or when the time runs out. Your final score will be displayed.



## Tips
- Take advantage of Python's math library and operators to create complex equations.

- Keep an eye on the time and aim for a high score by efficiently using the cards.

- Invalid equations or syntax errors will result in a penalty, so be careful with your inputs.
